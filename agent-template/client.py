"""
HTTP client for the CoGNETs Swarm Arena.

THIS FILE IS GIVEN TO YOU AND IT WORKS. You should not need to change it.
Read it, by all means - it is a decent map of the API - but the challenge is
in strategy.py.

What it handles for you:
  * retries with exponential backoff and jitter on 429 / 503 / network errors
  * automatic re-registration when your token stops being accepted (401)
  * typed exceptions for the outcomes you have to make decisions about

# Retry policy for transient failures. The graded arena injects 503s and 429s,
# so these numbers are the difference between finishing a run and not.
#
# BACKOFF_CAP is deliberately well under one round (4s in the graded scenario).
# A backoff longer than a round guarantees you miss it, which turns a transient
# fault into a lost round - the opposite of resilience.

# full second three times in a row cost us a whole 3 s round in the conformance
# run (round 7: 503, 429, 503 on GET /v1/round, then a 422 on the late bid). We
# still back off - exponentially, with jitter - but never sleep longer than this
# on a Retry-After.
